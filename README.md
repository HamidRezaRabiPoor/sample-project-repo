thanks to **linus** for creating this super powerful tool to simplify the issues for developers in order to promote their tasks. this is unbelieveable, irreplaceable, and irresistable equipment each programmer should be --familiar-- with.

And also thanks to those who spend time, sharring their precious experience and knowledge to others in the aim of having an active community.
